# Neofetch Merlin Config

- The following is my custom configuration file for [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) using ascii art made by [Adithyan-KV](https://github.com/Adithyan-KV) and several additional perameters using the 
`prin` option in Neofetch. 

- My Terminal Emulator of choice is [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix) and therefore some of my customizations are tilix specific.

sudo apt-get install protonvpn
```
#### Lutris

cd nerd-fonts
```
##### Install all nerd fonts
`./iinstall.sh`
##### Install individual font or fonts

###### Example:
```
./install.sh CodeNewRoman
./install.sh ProggyClean
```

## Additions to Neofetch Config
- This is done usinng the [prin](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Customizing-Info#prin) option

### Bootloader
```
prin "異Bootloader" "$(efibootmgr | rg "Boot`efibootmgr | rg "BootOrder" | cut -c12-15`" | cut -c11-)"
```
- uses [efibootmgr](https://github.com/rhboot/efibootmgr) and grep or ripgrep to find the default 1st bootloader then grep again using that number string to determine the default bootloaders label.

### Lutris Games
`prin " Lutris Games" "$(ls /home/$USER/.local/share/lutris/banners | wc -l)"`
- Uses the `ls` and `wc` commands to show how many games I have installed on [Lutris](https://github.com/lutris/lutris)

### Sound Server
`prin "墳Sound Server" "$(pactl info | rg 'Server Name' | cut -c13-)"`
- I have started using Pipewire as a sound Server and since its still new and part incorporated into my distro by default it is important to make sure the system is still using it.
- I use `pactl info` with `grep` or `rg`(ripgrep) to make sure pipewire is working properly.

### Alternate method to display terminal font on Tilix
`prin " Terminal Font" "$(dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/profiles/[Profile String]/ | rg "font" --max-count=1 | cut -c6-)"`
- For whatever reason the `term_font` function doesn't work on tilix. I'm not sure why.
- See the [Neofetch Wiki](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Terminal-and-Terminal-Font-detection) for more info about this.
- As a result I am using `dconf dump` with `grep` or `rg`(ripgrep) to find this infomation.
- this requires you to find the string assosiated with your Tilix profile using the command 
`dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/profiles`

![Find-tilix-profile-string](/Preview/Tilix_Profile_String.png)

- This implementation is problematic and may not alsways work. However it has worked for me so far.

### ProtonVpn Server
`prin "旅 ProtonVPN Server" "$(protonvpn-cli s | rg "Server" --max-count=1 | cut -c11-)"`
- This simply displays which ProtonVPN Server I am connected to too.

### Added glyphs to all function labels
- This is accomplished by installing any [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
- Set installed nerd-font as the font used by your terminal emulator
- In Tilix this can be done by opening Preferences, Selecting your profile. checking the box for "Custom Font" and selecting whichever Nerd Font that's installed.
- In other Terminal Emulators you may have to edit a config file manually.
    - In kitty open `/home/$USER/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` in your editor of choice.
    - In Alacritty the config file is located in `/home/$USER/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`

## Thoughts
- Neofetch is a fun and useful tool which is widely used and highly customizable.
- Hopefully my config example will inspire others to create new useful customizations.
- My additions are very simple and slightly hacky, so I'm sure others can easily create new and amazing additions. 
- This is the 1st project I have posted in several years.
- Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
